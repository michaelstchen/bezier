Does not compile on the instructional machines. Make sure glm, glut,
GLEW, and freeglut are all installed. Should compile with "make"
if all these libraries are installed.
      - glm was used for vector and matrix math
      - glut, freeglut, and GLEW were used to create the
        OpenGL viewing window.

After compilation, run:
      ./as3 [inputfile] [param] [-a]

All of the code for initializing a window and for applying a shader borrowed
heavily from the OpenGL/GLSL tutorials at the following sites:
      - http://www.lighthouse3d.com/
      - http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/

The teacup control points were taken from:
      - http://www.holmes3d.net/graphics/teapot/
      *** IMPORTANT ***
      The control points vertices for the teacup are stored in the reverse
      order that my program uses. To get the correct shading, swap
      "dPdu" and "dPdv" on line 140 of mesh.cpp.

All required features are implemented.

Optional Features Implemented:
      - video of program in use (see website)
      - reads and displays OBJ files
      - implement a custom shader (see Shaders folder).
